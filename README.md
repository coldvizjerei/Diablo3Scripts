Some scripts for when playing Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls.

Clicking many times buying or gambling an item is repetitive and wearing on both your hand and wrist, as well as the mouse. 
Scripts solve the problem, making use of the caps locks and scroll lock key. 

Clicker - When the caps lock key is toggled on, holding left click will rapidly left click while it is held down. Similarly, right click will do the same.

ClickerDHSmokeScreen - When the scroll lock key is toggled on, it will automatically press the "f" key on the keyboard every 1.5 seconds. The "f" key is mapped to a skill that lasts 1.5 seconds so by having this script, it ensures 100% uptime of the skill.
